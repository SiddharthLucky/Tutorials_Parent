Core JAVA basics notes:

- Instance variables as part of the methods of a class, but mainly to maintain the states of an object.

- Static final makes all the values that are defined with the variable, makes it not be able to reinitialize it again and the value wont be changed
final keyword the value cant be changed, decalre the final variable un uppercase.

- When an to string method is created that overrides the parent to string, you can directly access the information by sys.out(object name) which generally means
sys.out(object name.toString()),

- If we do not give a toString() method from above point, if the object is not null the toString will be called automatically. or if the object is null it returns
an new null reference exception.

- When you find more reusable code, you can use static methods to reduce redundant code.

- All of these static methods can be moved to a util class to keep the code cleaner, the util class
mainly should contain mostly only static emthods. Kinda to increase reusability.

- Keep in mind the class designs, make them look cleaner.
