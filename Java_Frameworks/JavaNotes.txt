Core JAVA basics notes:

------------------Session 1--------------

- Instance variables as part of the methods of a class, but mainly to maintain the states of an object.

- Static final makes all the values that are defined with the variable, makes it not be able to reinitialize it again and the value wont be changed
final keyword the value cant be changed, decalre the final variable un uppercase.

- When an to string method is created that overrides the parent to string, you can directly access the information by sys.out(object name) which generally means
sys.out(object name.toString()),

- If we do not give a toString() method from above point, if the object is not null the toString will be called automatically. or if the object is null it returns
an new null reference exception.

- When you find more reusable code, you can use static methods to reduce redundant code.

- All of these static methods can be moved to a util class to keep the code cleaner, the util class
mainly should contain mostly only static emthods. Kinda to increase reusability.

- Keep in mind the class designs, make them look cleaner.

- Static decleration will keep one copy per class, example only 1 employee then the methods should be static.

- You can create constructor from source, generate constructor on fields in class.

- fir salary conmapre you can use terenary operator - example directly
return emp.getsal() > emp2.getsal() ? emp1|emp2
-------------------Session 2--------------


- Once the reference to the object is updated the value will also be updated ie when you
pass the object as a parameter. Depends on the tye of the variable declared as
instance is accessable to what.

- Var args can be used when you dont know how many arguments are coming through, args are strings by default.
indecated by using type and ... dots, example function funcName(String...args)

- Any objects that need to be released or for garbage collecter to collect, you can include all of them in finalize.

- There are times when you want multiple blocks in switch to be executed,
you may not define a break so that the below block will be executed untill 
break is encountered.

- 2 variations of for loops, regular, enhanced for loops.
enhanced for loops - for(decleration: expression)


------------------Session 3-------------------

- When there are multiple parameters passed, it i sbest to pass an array or the object itself, if there are more fields to be accessed, it i sbest to
send the object, that way you wont have to change the methods again and again, increases usability.

- In this case employee arrays case if u reach the max size you can copy all the values in the arrays to a new array with double the size.

- You can make a variable to manage the current size of the array basing on what operations are being run on.

- Make it a point that the Main class file should depend on the class with implementations but not vice versa.

- The operations class ie, class with operations methods should not contain any Syste.out.print statements.

- The database generally contains basic functions like Find employee and all, basic CRUD operations.

- If there are a lot of information to be gathered by the user, you can make a new private method and access it to return an object.

- Any class if it takes parameters and makes an activity can be static as it wouldnt have any isntance methods.

- Since you are assigned to make an array management class, you dont have to make an array in the main class, as you dont have to
return the array always as there should only be one copy in the util class that manages all the operations as array creating and deletion and so on.

- Immutable classes are defined as final as thier calue will not be changed, thsi helps us achieve thread safety.

- Check when you need aggregation or composition - as times you need that u need 2 seperate objects or fi you have to make the 2 object depended on
the first object, for making the two objects dependant, you can initlaize the second object in the constructor of the first object.

- More than 2 levels of inhertice can cause testing problems. For most multilevel problems it generally goes with a "is a" than a "has a" relation



------------------- Session 4---------------

- If you are planning on making a string synchronized - only 1 thread is allowd to access it. For this use string builder as it can allow acces to multiple threads.

- Make sure u dont make the string builder as an instance variable so that only one variable gets initialized and all the threads have to wait for the single object
to be released.

------------------- Session 5---------------

- Advantages of using prepared statement is you can avoid SQL injection.


------------------- Session 6 - DAO Pattern---------------

- The DAO class can only contain strictly CRUD operations, rest of all 
operations can be handled by services class.

- Three types of inner classes, Member classes, Anonymous clases and local class.

- Reading from the file and all should be strictly handled by service class.
Verify what you have to keep in the utilities class.

- From java8, you can use the default function where in you can only implement
teh function in a class only if you need it.

- You can use System.out::println in a lambda function to directly print the value.
foreach(System.out::println) is same as foreach(p -> system.out.println(p))
such are called method references

-------------------- Session 7 - Multi Threading----------------

Multi Threading, mOstly for batch application

- All threads are executed are maintained in a call Stack, each thread has its own indivisual call Stack

- The Job and the thread implementation can be in the same class file.

- We dont have to call the thread run method directly it will be called internally by the start method. if we run using directly the run()
it runs as a method and not a thread.

- Look into premptive scheduling and thread priority;

- For a functional Interface, you can use lambda expressions.

-------------------- Session 8 - Generics & Wildcards----------------

- Callable API can be used to return a Future object using generics, determine the return type in a later stage.

- Executor service is used for thread pooling, fixed no of threads created, to run assigned jobs - Read more information from Jenkov, concurrent executor service.

- Blocking queue can be used to restrict pushing into the queue when it reaches a specified size.

- If you dont specify a type, it takes in any kind of value

ex - mylist<int> sets integer values , myList<String> sets string values, myList = new myList accepts datatypes of anyking

- Wildcard Boundries - You can specify boundries to generics by using (generic name) extends Class Name or Interface Name. Helps you access inner methods of the types.

- When u have a debug pointer, you can use step into in the debug to see which implementation it is going to, also you can use Ctrl + T to navigate to the method being used.

- Reflections, will give u an ability to modify data at runtime, construct object at runtime.

----------------------Session 9 - Maven------------------

- In maven you have to main folder and test folder

main -> java, resources - files that access as resources. If a java file is here it will not be compiled by the compiler.

test -> can have all the test cases of the project. Not included in the final build.

- pon is necessary for building, unique information should be specified called GAV

- Group, Artifact, Version ID .Optionally you can also use plugins into maven.

- SNAPSHOT - means still app is in developement state, can be changed to RELEASE.

- Packaging can be used to tell if you want to generate a jar or a var file.

- If v is mission in dependency, the version is inherited from the parent tags
you can also have nested dependecy tags.

- Changing version in one place changes in all o fthe files.

- default name is same as artifact name = if not defined.

- The plugins can be added geenrally to the build part.

- main files part of maven are src and pom

- The local repo is where maven downlaods all the required dependencies - should be stored
in the users file.

- In the repo, there is a .settings file which contains all the creds to the various servers
- good practice to maintain various settings file so that it can be user specific.

- After compilation all the files will be present in the target file.

- mvn clean can be used to erase the target directory.

- For test cases to run you can use mvn test

- For creating the jar file you can use mvn package.

- mvn install moves the files to the repository.


- Commands to be used -
1. mvn compile
2. mvn test
3. mvn package
4. mvn install
